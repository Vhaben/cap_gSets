About
-----

*Set* was one of the staple card games of my youth that rarely wasn't within arm's reach of our family dining table. Over years of playing, my father and I regularly wondered about the mathematical foundation of the gameplay. One question in particular often came to mind, that we one day decided to test. Here, I recreate that process in a much more efficient way.  
But, rather than reveal the details here, I suggest you explore the history of this mini-project, the underpinings of the combinatorics, and the simplicity of the code.
